# Flight-Dynamics-Control-Project
This project was for my Dynamics &amp; Controls class in which I created a control law given an aircraft model. The control law includes altitude scheduling, altitude hold, waypoint scheduling, bank angle hold, and ability to control aircraft with an Xbox controller.
